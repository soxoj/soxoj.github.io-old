## Who am I

I am **OSINT enthusiast** with a background in cybersecurity and software development. 🔐 

⚒️ I started getting into OSINT in 2015, by making tools for information gathering and processing. Check the links below or visit [my GitHub repositories page](https://github.com/soxoj?tab=repositories).

🎙️ Since 2018 I've been talking about OSINT, search methods, and privacy at public events; was a speaker at large international conferences. You can look at some of my talks in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-6osVePbwJa2Tp2Bc2EUI1p).

🎥 Later I founded the **OSINT mindset community** (2020 - [first post](https://t.me/osint_mindset/5), 2022 - [first meetup](https://t.me/osint_mindset/94)). The community has 15K subscribers, almost 4K members of [Investigation Forum](https://t.me/+GMxoDCvLO0k0MWRi), and dozens of active members and speakers. You can watch records of talks from [monthly meetups on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-7A2tKggMryk18tbwC7jLhX), listen OSINT mindset [podcasts on platforms](https://osint-mindset.mave.digital/), and read the excellent [wiki on Gitbook](https://osint-mindset.gitbook.io).

## Experience

💼 Currently, I am head of the Center of Excellence in [Social Links](https://sociallinks.io/): we conduct investigations, teach OSINT, and help to develop new methods and tools.

👷 I have had experience before in software development (mostly Python, also Go, Lua), cybersecurity (antibot/antifraud protection, pentest) and management.

✍️ You can find my articles and guides in the Telegram channel of [OSINT mindset](https://t.me/osint_mindset) community, [on GitHub](https://github.com/soxoj) or on [my Substack](https://soxoj.substack.com/).
